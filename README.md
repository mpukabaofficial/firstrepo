# My First Data Science Repository

## Introduction

### What are we going to learn?
This repository is a hands-on guide to my journey into Data Science using R. It will cover the fundamentals, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and data visualization techniques. This is the first step in understanding how to work with data effectively.

This is the first added line...

### Key Objectives
- Understand the basics of Data Science with R.
- Learn how to manipulate, clean, and explore datasets.
- Build and evaluate predictive models.
- Visualize data to uncover meaningful insights.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

/data # Raw and processed datasets /notebooks # RMarkdown files for analysis and visualization /scripts # R scripts for data processing and modeling /output # Generated visualizations, reports, and model outputs /README.md # Project overview and instructions


## Tools and Libraries
We will use the following tools and libraries throughout the project:
- **R**: Programming language
- **tidyverse**: For data manipulation and visualization
- **ggplot2**: For data visualization
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation
- **caret**: For machine learning
- **RMarkdown**: For creating reproducible reports

## Initial Dataset
The first dataset we’ll work with is [Dataset Name], which contains information about [Dataset Description]. It’s a great starting point for learning fundamental data manipulation and analysis skills in R.

## Learning Path
1. **Setup Environment**: Install R and RStudio, set up necessary packages.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and standardize datasets using `tidyverse`.
3. **EDA**: Generate descriptive statistics and visualize patterns using `ggplot2`.
4. **Statistical Modeling**: Build a regression or classification model with `caret`.
5. **Final Project**: Use what you’ve learned to analyze a new dataset and create a meaningful report.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/first-data-science-repo.git

2. Open RStudio and set the working directory to the repository:

setwd("path/to/your/repository")

    Install required packages:

    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "ggplot2", "rmarkdown"))

    Start exploring the datasets and scripts in the repository.
