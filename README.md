# My First Data Science Repository

## Introduction

### What are we going to learn?
This repository is a hands-on guide to my journey into Data Science using R. It will cover the fundamentals, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and data visualization techniques. This is the first step in understanding how to work with data effectively.

This is the first added line...

### Key Objectives
- Understand the basics of Data Science with R.
- Learn how to manipulate, clean, and explore datasets.
- Build and evaluate predictive models.
- Visualize data to uncover meaningful insights.

## Tools and Libraries
We will use the following tools and libraries throughout the project:
- **R**: Programming language
- **tidyverse**: For data manipulation and visualization
- **ggplot2**: For data visualization
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation
- **caret**: For machine learning
- **RMarkdown**: For creating reproducible reports
